# Project Title

This is a web scrapping tool to check tha availability of this AWESOME jaquet from [Golpe](https://www.golpeofficial.com/).

![Image of my future jaquet](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/14ad66_676a607c7544475b95472b7395a27a7f~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_500,h_500,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/14ad66_676a607c7544475b95472b7395a27a7f~mv2.webp)

## Motivation

I was tired of accessing this site everyday to see if the jaquet I want was available, so I took the easy path and built this crawller for do this task for me.

## Disclaimer

My initial intent was to set up the [emailJS](https://github.com/eleith/emailjs) to notify me when the jaquet gets available again, but I might have forgot my free license limit...

## P.S.

[Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) is an AWEOME tool and I'll still learning it!
